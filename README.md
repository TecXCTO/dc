# DC
Decentrelised Computing
```
Decentralized computing distributes processing power, storage, and applications across a network of independent nodes (like
personal computers or servers) instead of relying on a single central server, using peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and often
blockchain for coordination, creating a resilient, private, and cost-effective alternative to traditional centralized cloud
models for tasks like AI, data storage,
and computation.

# How it Works

Distributed Resources: Instead of giant data centers, it pools unused CPU/GPU power and storage from many individual devices,
turning them into a global computing network.

P2P & Blockchain: Resources are exchanged directly between users (peer-to-peer), with blockchain or similar protocols handling
coordination, payment, and security via smart contracts.

Node Collaboration: Individual nodes operate independently but work together, sharing tasks and data across the network.

# Key Advantages

Enhanced Security & Privacy: No single point of failure or data concentration, reducing breach risks and offering greater
user control.

Cost Efficiency: Leverages underutilized hardware, often resulting in lower costs than traditional cloud providers.
Scalability & Resilience: Elastic capacity and fault tolerance, as the network can easily scale and withstand localized outages.

Reduced Vendor Lock-in: Avoids dependence on single large providers.

# Examples & Use Cases

Decentralized Storage: Platforms like Filecoin and Storj allow users to rent out spare hard drive space.

AI & Machine Learning: Distributes intensive AI model training across many GPUs for faster, cheaper results.

Web3 Applications: Powers decentralized apps (dApps) and services. 

# Contrast with Centralized Computing

Centralized: Relies on large data centers (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud) for all functions, creating potential
 chokepoints.

Decentralized: Spreads functions across many independent nodes, offering greater distribution and resilience.
